Forecasting country population as a time series.
Author: Wojciech Gajewski

This application forecasts population of the selected countries using the Holt-Winters filtering model. The population data comes from here (http://data.okfn.org/data/core/population/r/population.csv). More on the Holts-Winters filtering prediction model can be found here: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/HoltWinters.html
The application allows to choose the alpha parameter of the fitting, the country in question as well as the number of years to predict.
The bands on the prediction plot represent the 80th and 95th confidence interval.
